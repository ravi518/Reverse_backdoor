# Reverse_backdoor
This python file will create a backdoor connection in the victim pc when it runs.That backdoor connection got catched by a listener listening on the given port and gives the cmd access to the attacker.So one can make this file run in the oponent computer can can get cmd access.But one thing have to do first edit the downloaded file and change the given ip to attackers ip means your own pc ip.<br/>

Guide:<br/>
[+] rev_backdoor.py is the file to be runned the victim's pc in which we want to create a backdoor and don't forget to change the ip in the code.<br/>
